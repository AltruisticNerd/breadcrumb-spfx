# Breadcrumb SPFX Solution

IN DEVELOPMENT - NO PUBLIC RELEASE YET

The Breadcrumb SPFX Feature will add a global breadcrumb to your Office 365 SharePoint site page header.

The breadcrumb is configured using a Site Collection list that creates a hierarchy of pages, sites, lists, and libraries to mimic a hierarchical navigation.
